# fake-startup-site

This is a simple Vite + React + Tailwind project.
Visit the root of the site for a splash page at `lkw.lol` complete with a snarky
contact form. The original startup pitch generator now lives at `/brainrotaas`.
There you can type a startup idea and instantly generate a pretend pitch. Enter
something like `Uber for squirrels` and you'll get:
There's also `/shi-spot` where you pick emoji nouns, verbs, and locations to
generate a silly picture.

- A startup name
- A three-word tagline
- A VC-flavored hero paragraph
- A shiny call-to-action button

Starting with this version, the pitch can be generated by OpenAI via a
serverless endpoint if you provide a key.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI key:
   ```bash
   # .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   ```
   The key is optional. If omitted, the app falls back to the built-in random generator.
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
