# fake-startup-site

This is a simple Vite + React + Tailwind project. The homepage now lets you type in a startup idea and instantly generates a pretend pitch. Enter something like `Uber for squirrels` and you'll get:

- A startup name
- A three-word tagline
- A VC-flavored hero paragraph
- A shiny call-to-action button

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
