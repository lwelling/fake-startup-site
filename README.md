# fake-startup-site

This is a simple Vite + React + Tailwind project. The homepage now lets you type
in a startup idea and instantly generates a pretend pitch. Enter something like
`Uber for squirrels` and you'll get:

- A startup name
- A three-word tagline
- A VC-flavored hero paragraph
- A shiny call-to-action button

Starting with this version, the pitch can be generated by OpenAI if you provide
a key.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI key:
   ```bash
   # .env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   ```
   The key is optional. If omitted, the app falls back to the built-in random generator.
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
